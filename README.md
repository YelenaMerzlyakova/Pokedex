# Pokedex ![alt text](https://static.posters.cz/image/750/poster/pokemon-eve-i32673.jpg "Pokemon")

[Here](https://krisderycke.github.io/Pokedex/) is the link to our excercise.

## What:
Make a Pokedeck using the Pokemon API.
Learning DOM-manipulation based on AJAX results.

## Who:
I teamed up with Yelena. We made 1 repo and pushed/pulled quite alot.

## How:
We first made a rough html draw, then implemented the first Poke API, and called the results using `axios.get`. When that worked, we used the 2nd API to get the evolutions and adjusted the HTML. In the end, we styled the app with CSS.
